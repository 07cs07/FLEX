# FLEX

## TODO:

### Must haves:
- README
 - Note only supported back to iOS 6
 - Usage & feature explanations
 - Exception breakpoint note
- Unsupported type argument input view 
- Access live instances from the class explorer
- Quick access to alloc/new from class explorer
- Inheritance chain section in object explorer
- Better status bar managerment on iOS 7 (especially if not using view controller based status bar management)
- Method calling feedback toast when methods that return nil or void are called successfully
- Alert when method calling fails
- Trigger scroll to top from taps on the nav bar title for modals with the status bar hidden
- Add more common fields to custom view object explorer.
- Blog post
- Cleanup and comments

### Nice to haves:
- Image preview in the file browser for image files
- Support setting mutable array/dictionary properties
- Mutable collection editing
- Drill in from class explorer to properties, ivars, and methods for full names and attributes ("call/set" disabled/hidden)
- Demo app
- File browser: try to parse binary files as plists even if they lack the .plist extension
- UIColor argument input view

### Community feature ideas
- Swift runtime introspection (swift classes, swift objects on the heap, etc.)
- Layer hierarchy support
- Consider a custom data approach that allows users to prioritize their own relevant information.
- Keyboard shortcuts (that don't interfere with existing keyboard shortcuts)
- Add new NSUserDefault key/value pair on the fly
